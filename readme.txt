[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod adds a multi-tool to the game.

All of the following tools are usable within this Swiss knife:

- Knife
- Can Opener
- Lockpick
- Scissors (sewing kit)
- Screwdriver
- Handsaw (no planks, just firewood)

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be run on both client and server.

Make sure to also copy the types.xml config into your server mpmissions folder.

NOTE: DO NOT ADD THE SUB-TOOL ITEMS INTO YOUR LOOT TABLE, or they will not store the item health properly and when retracted will break the tool. For complex nerdy reasons not worth explaining to the average server admin who doesn't care - the tool manages its health internally when it is extended/retracted. Only spawn the base item (ZenSwissKnife). This applies to markets/airdrops/other JSON spawns/etc too.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.com

Buy Me A Coffee:

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
